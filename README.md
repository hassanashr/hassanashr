## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hassan Ashraf!
Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm a double major in Computer Engineering and Mathematics in the American University in Cairo. I love virtually all what is there in computer science and pure mathematics! I have been also an undergraduate research assistant in the American University in Cairo, working on creating ethical path planning systems for autonomous vehicles using graph theory and linear temporal logic among others.

I am especially interested in Machine Learning and often upload my solutions to Kaggle Challenges, LeetCode problems, Codeforces problems, programming projects, and solutions to self-studied books here.
